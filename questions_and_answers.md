<p>

#### Answer: C

<i>We called a function named sum that have two parameters, a and b. Here a is a number and b is a string, we can not add number and string mathematically. So javascript is converting the number to string thats why instead of adding, a and b are pairing up with each other. And sub will return '12'</i>

###### 5. Write the `correct answer` from the following options and give an explanation (2-5 lines).

```javascript
let count = 0;
const nums = [0, 1, 2, 3];

});

console.log(count);
```

- A: 1
- B: 2
- C: 3
- D: 4

<details><summary><b>C</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: ?

<i>We are making forEach loop here. Inside the loop we have a condition if the num is true the count will add 1 with it. As we know 0 means false. The first value of num is 0, so the first cycle of the loop will not execute. After that all value are true and the cycle will continue 3 times adding 1. And finish the loop returning the result 3. That why C is correct answer</i>
